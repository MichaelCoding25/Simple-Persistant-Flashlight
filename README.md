# Simple-Persistent-Flashlight
 A simple FiveM script to enable the functionality of having persistent flashlight being turned on or off even while not aiming them.

## Download & Installation
 - Download the most recent `.zip` file/archive from the **[releases](https://github.com/MichaelCoding25/Simple-Persistent-Flashlight/releases)** page.
 - Extract the contents to your `server-data/resources/` directory.
 - Ensure you've added the following to your `server.cfg` file:
 ```
 start persistent-flashlight
 ```
 
## Support
 - If you have any questions about the script feel free to contact me on Discord: `Melodic#9770`, [create an issue](https://github.com/MichaelCoding25/Simple-Persistent-Flashlight/issues/new) in the repository, or ask in the [FiveM Forum](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-free-simple-persistent-flashlight/3586427).
 
## Performance
 - The script is very minimal and as such should have no hit on performance.
 - It only utilizes `0.01ms` of cpu, and in addition uses garbage collection for the memory so that also stays very low.
